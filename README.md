# concrete5 API Client

A PHP Client Library for the concrete5 API. This library uses [concrete5 Nightcap](http://github.com/concrete5/nightcap) as the backbone of a PHP client for a REST API.

The library supports the password grant, the client credentials grant and the authorization grant. Documentation for these flows is coming soon, but practical examples for client credentials and the password grants can be found in an example console application:
